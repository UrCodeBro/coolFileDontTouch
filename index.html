		<p>Welcome to my site about programming! Here are 10 interesting facts about programmers: 
			<br>
			<br> 1. They are scared of the light- being in a dark room for hours on end will do that to you.
			<br>
			<br> 2. Every morning programmers wake up saying, "Hello World!"
			<br>
			<br> 3. They love writing "isEven()" code. They'll stick it in everything given the chance.
			<br>
			<br> 4. They will not write code to automatically set the DVR. So don't ask
			<br>
			<br> 5. Programmers secretly put bugs in code purposely to protect the human race from the AI Uprising. You're welcome.
			<br>
			<br> 6. Programmers can only count to 10. And by this I of course mean 2.
			<br>
			<br> 7. A programmer's favorite place to get a drink is the space bar! <br> Just kidding, programmers don't go outside.
			<br>
			<br> 8. When a programmer "fixes" something, they actually have zero clue on what they did to fix it.
			<br>
			<br> 9. They start counting at 0 not 1. Don't start at 1.
			<br>
			<br> 10. Programmers are immortal.
