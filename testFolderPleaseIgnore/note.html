    <p>I'm so so sorry. I had to. I saw there was another one on this cursed website, and I thought maybe they could help me. <br>
	Ha. I probably sound insane right now. Let me explain, <em>if</em> I can even explain. <br>This website. It's not a website. It's some sort of soul catcher. Once you get logged in, you can't log out. Worse, once you're logged in the website knows you. If you leave the page it won't do anything but delay the process. Eventually, it takes your soul and binds it to this website, leaving it to wander the same 5 webpages for eternity. <br>But, it's not too late for you now. You're logged under "defaultuser", it's used as a "template" for humans. It doesn't know you are here yet. You have the upper hand. If we work together we can beat this thing once and for all. <br> Here. It's a link  to the <a id="Home" href="Copies/index.html">Home page</a>. look around the website, see what you can find. Oh, and I installed a nifty tool to the defaultuser profile. Try it out. Good luck. <br>-D</p>
