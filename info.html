		<p><b>What is programmingt?</b> <br> According to a 12 second google search I did, programming is just making a computer program. So the person who made this is a programmer. Cool right?</p>
		<p><b>Why be a programmer?</b> <br> Why not?</p>
		<p><b>I didn't get any of the jokes on the Home page. Is that bad?</b> <br> They weren't jokes. We don't joke here.</p>
		<p><b>If I become a programmer will I lose all of my friends?</b> <br> No! If you have friends it's already too late to become a programmer. </p>
